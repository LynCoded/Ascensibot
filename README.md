# Ascensibot
Sharing love, light, and positive messages on Twitter.

## About Ascensibot 
This Twitter bot was created to spread positivity, happiness, and light to all who comes across it. Using [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) and [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/), I created a boiler plate template via #origin# that transmits positive affirmations and fun reminders every 6 hours.

## Usage
Use this [Tracery JSON](http://air.decontextualize.com/tracery/) script to build your own Twitter bot! I'm happy to share my words- change the phrases, adjectives, and nouns to create your own script, then plug it into Cheap Bots Done Quick with your own Twitter credentials to use.

### Enjoy, Share, and Spread Love
If you enjoyed this app, share the love! Send in a pull request to add additional affirmations, share the app with someone looking to make a Twitter bot, or follow [@Ascensibot](http://twitter.com/ascensibot) for positive affirmations on your Twitter feed.
